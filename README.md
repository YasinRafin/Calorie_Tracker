# Calorie_Tracker
This is a calorie tracker system. This can be used for tracking the calories of one's consumed food. It also shows how many percentage of carbohydrate, protein and fats are present in his consumed food in a pie chart. One can see what amount of calories he consumed amonng his expected goal calories. I have built this using Django in the backend and HTML, CSS , BootStrap in the frontend.
